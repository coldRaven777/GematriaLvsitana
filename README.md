# GematriaLvsitana

**GematriaLvsitana** is an experimental API that explores Portuguese words through the lens of gematria — a system that assigns numerical value to letters and words. This project is inspired by similar systems in Hebrew and Greek, adapted to the Portuguese language.

## ✨ Features (Current)

- 🔢 **Calculate Gematria Value**  
  Input a Portuguese word and get its gematria value.

- 🔍 **Find Words by Gematria**  
  Retrieve all Portuguese words that match a given gematria value.

- 🔁 **Find Equivalent Words**  
  Given a word, find all other words with the same gematria value.

## 📦 Planned Features

- 📚 Dictionary expansion and support for compound words
- 🔤 Multiple gematria calculation modes (e.g. standard, ordinal)
- 🧠 Semantic filtering and word categories
- 🌐 Web interface for exploring and visualizing results
- 📊 Stats and frequency analysis of gematria values

## 🚧 Status

This project is in **early development**. The core API is functional but minimal, and the codebase is evolving rapidly. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
